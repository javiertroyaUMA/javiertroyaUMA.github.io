				<h2 class="title">Genetic Algorithms applied to Routing Protocols - State of the art 2008 and 2009</a></h2>
				<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
				<div class="entry">
				<p> The work presented here tries to cover a part of the state of the art related to the application of Genetic Algorithms 
					to the problem of Routing Protocols in different networks between 2008 and 2010. First of all, let us introduce the concepts 
					of “genetic algorithms” and “routing protocols”.
		 		</p>
				<h1 class="title">Genetic Algorithms</a></h1>
				<p> Genetic algorithms were formally introduced in the United States by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Holland">John Holland</a> at the University of Michigan, in the 1970s. The continuing 
					price/performance improvements of computational systems have made them attractive for some types of optimization. In particular, 
					genetic algorithms work very well on mixed (continuous and discrete) combinatorial problems. They are less susceptible to get 
					'stuck' at local optima than gradient search methods. But they tend to be computationally expensive. 				
				</p>
				<p> To use a genetic algorithm, the solution to a problem must be represented as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_%28genetic_algorithm%29">chromosome</a>. The genetic algorithm then creates 
					a population of solutions and applies genetic operators such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_%28genetic_algorithm%29">mutation</a>
					 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_%28genetic_algorithm%29">crossover</a> to evolve the solutions in order to find the best one(s). 
				</p>
				<p> The three most important aspects of using genetic algorithms are: (1) definition of the objective function, (2) definition and implementation 
					of the genetic representation, and (3) definition and implementation of the genetic operators. Once these three have been defined, 
					the generic genetic algorithm should work fairly well. Appart from this, many different variations can be defined in order to improve performance, 
					find multiple optima, or parallelize the algorithms. 
				</p>

				<h1 class="title">Routing Protocols</a></h1>
				<p> A routing protocol is a protocol that specifies how routers communicate with each other, disseminating information that enables them to select 
					routes from any two nodes on a computer network, the choice of the route being done by routing algorithms. Each router has a priori 
					knowledge only of networks attached to it directly. A routing protocol shares this information first among immediate neighbours, 
					and then throughout the network. This way, routers gain knowledge of the topology of the network. Depending on which nodes will receive 
					the messages from the source node, we have different kinds of routing:	
					<ul>
						<li><b>a) </b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast"><b>Multicast</b></a> addressing is a network technology for the delivery of information to a group of destinations simultaneously using 
							the most efficient strategy to deliver the messages over each link of the network only once, creating copies only when the 
							links to the multiple destinations split. In multicast there is a one-to-many association between network addresses and network 
							endpoints, each destination address identifies a set of receiver endpoints, to which all information is replicated. </li>
						<li><b>b) </b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast"><b>Anycast</b></a> is a network addressing and routing scheme whereby data is routed to the topologically "nearest" or "best" node. In anycast, 
							there is a one-to-one-of-many association between network addresses and network endpoints, each destination address identifies 
							a set of receiver endpoints, but only one of them is chosen at any given time to receive information from any given sender. </li>
						<li><b>c) </b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast"><b>Unicast</b></a> transmission is the sending of messages to a single network destination host on a packet switching network. In unicast, there is a one-to-one association between network address and 
							network endpoint, each destination address uniquely identifies a single receiver endpoint. </li>
					</ul>

				<h1 class="title">Application of Genetic Algorithms to Routing Protocols</a></h1>
				<p> In the table shown <a href="TableGA_RP.htm">here</a>, some genetic algorithms for improving the performance of routing protocols are described. Each GA has been extracted 
					from a different paper, all of them written in the last two years (2008 and 2009). The table presents just a summary of them, so the interested 
					reader should consult the papers for a complete understanding of the algorithms. References to the papers are provided, but access to 
					them is not provided due to copyright reasons. The aim of this work is not to compare all the algorithms presented here between 
					them. In fact, each of them is compared with other algorithms (which try to solve the same problem) in the section “Simulation Results”. The
					references using within the <a href="TableGA_RP.htm">table</a> can be seen after it.
