abstract = {The methodology under the term model-based software engineering (MBSE) gained importance already around 20 years ago, after the publication of the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initiative by the Object Management Group (OMG). This development methodology continues to evolve, giving rise to recent proposals such as low-code or no-code. Something that has not changed, as recent surveys point out, is the need for powerful testing approaches and tools for these new methodologies. In MBSE, test inputs are models, so it is key to have frameworks for model generation. However, the main shortcomings of existing model-generation frameworks are their performance limitations and the need for domain-specific knowledge, which seriously hampers their industrial adoption. In this paper, we present the Yekta low-code framework that allows to generate models in a simple way through the application of metaheuristic algorithms.}
